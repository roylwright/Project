Menu was my capstone project. While it worked, I would not call it perfect. I plan to rewrite this (have tracked down my issues, but have not updated the project yet as of 1/25/18) and fix a few issues. Well, I rewote half the front end, forgot to update it to github, and deleted it by acident, so while I am glad it was here... (October 2018)
I had hoped to add an API to update my ingredients database, this became complicated because most of that data did not include volume for items, making many recipe elements dificult tp express. How much is a cup in grams? Depends too much on the density of the material in question. (not my current focus)
My knowledge changed, radically, while I was writing the project. Instead of making a separate table for ingredient in a recipe I would have made the linking table include a 'total_volume' element, to scale up individual ingredients, which would have forced me to write code to modify the rest of the totals, but it would have been more impressive to actually compensate for having a different amount of an ingredient to have. (Thanks to a coding challenge, this one is a minor issue. I can simply leave the totals off the database and add them to the entity to be calculated during the get data phase.) (Feb 2019)
I hate the create and then edit functionality. Much more user freindly to make a create apage that allows writing the entire recipe and then does the database management when the user is done and hits a "done" button.
My poject is not fancy. It works, and fails to be ugly.
It is database dependent, there is no content at all in the program, except a bit of diet info. It will do nothing unless you input ingredients into the database to use to make recipes. (Plan to write in some unit tests that add the required basic DB ingrdients March 2019)
