"DB" programs are for DB testing, currently configured for mySQL. DBTest simply checks to see if connection is made and displays "connected" to console if it works. DB will make a new table on the specified databse after you create it... (I wrote these after I determined that my database was instaled incorrectly to help me determine when I got things squared away.)
